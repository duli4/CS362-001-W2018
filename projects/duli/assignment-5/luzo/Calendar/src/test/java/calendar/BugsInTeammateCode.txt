First Bug:
In Appt.Java, the line 282, it is "String half = (getStartHour() >= 11) ? "pm" : "am";", it should change >= to >,
because if the start hour is 11, it also would be "pm", which is not correct, the start hour just greater and equal to 12
the time would be "pm".

Second Bug:
Also in Appt.java, the line 116 and 117, which is "if(startHour<=0 || startHour>=23)" and "this.valid=false;". 
In this logic, it means the start hour is 0 or 23, the appt would be invalid. It is not correct, because the start hour
can be 0 which is first hour in a day, and it also can be 23 which is last hour in a day. If start hour is 0 or 23 the 
appt should be valid. One of way to correct it is change the if statement "if(startHour<=0 || startHour>=23)" to 
"if(startHour<0 || startHour>23)"

Third Bug:
In the TimeTable.java, in the method "deleteAppt", line from 210 to 215, start at "for(int i=1;i<appts.size()-1;i++)"
which is to search a specific appt and remove it. For this if statement, it cannot search and remove first appt in the LinkedList 
appts, which is appts.get(0), and it also cannot search and remove the last appt in appts, which was appts.get(appts.size() - 1).
One of the solution is change the if statement "for(int i=1;i<appts.size()-1;i++)" to "for(int i=0;i<appts.size();i++)"
